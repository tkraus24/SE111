            <p style="border :5px solid green;">Hello! I am Tyler Kraus and I am a Quarter two here at <i>New England Tech.</i> I <b>LOVE</b> football and watch it everytime there is a game on. I love to hangout with my friends and play video games. Some games I have been playing recently are <u> Inscryption</u> and <u>Civ 5. </u> I work at a resturant and I work there with Brett. I also really like <b><u>NEIT</u></b>, I think it is a great fit for me and the food is very good. My teachers are also awesome and I really enjoy going to their classes.
