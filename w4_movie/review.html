                <h2><b>Review</b></h2>

                <p><b>Tyler Kraus</b> <i>Febuary 7 2021</i></p> 

               <p><i>Goodfellas</i> is a great movie about the gangster life of Henry Hill. It is an action packed crime thriller that has murders, crime, and robbery. This movie is rated R and is not for the faint of heart as there is drugs and murders but it does such a great job at storytelling and making me not want the movie to end. The classic look to the film and the change of scenery through the decades give the film a different type of imagery as it goes through nearly thirty years in two hours. </p>
                <br>
                <p><i>Goodfellas</i> being based on a true story makes this movie even better, Henry Hill became an informant and shared his story which Warner Bros ulitmately made the movie on. This movie does an incredible job at captivating an auidence and makes me wish there was a second one. Out of ten i would rate this movie a 9.6 and it is a must watch for everyone. </p>
